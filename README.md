## Project Overview
This project involves creating a responsive web application demonstrating the usage of modern front-end technologies and data visualization techniques. The application includes several key features that showcase my capabilities in front-end engineering, particularly in creating interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React was chosen for its component-based architecture, which allows for reusable and maintainable code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the application. Tailwind CSS was chosen for its flexibility and ease of use, allowing for rapid UI development.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used to run the backend server.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to set up a simple backend server to serve the React application and handle any backend logic if required.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript was used to add type safety and improve code quality.

### Data Visualization
- **D3.js**: A JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. It uses HTML, SVG, and CSS.

#### D3.js Implementation
In this project, D3.js is used to create interactive data visualizations. Below are the specific visualizations created:
- **Bar Chart**: Displays a simple bar chart representing some data metrics.
- **Pie Chart**: Visualizes data distribution with a pie chart.
- **Table**: Displays detailed data in a tabular format.
